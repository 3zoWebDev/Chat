Most of the local chats that we find will be again public and the interactions become public. So I was thinking of creating an application where people can talk in public as well as private.\r\n\r\n# Few Screen Shots\r\n#### Login Screen\r\n![Login screen](https://github.com/sudheeshshetty/Chat/blob/master/screenshots/login.png?raw=true)  \r\n#### Confirming request \r\n![Confirming request](https://github.com/sudheeshshetty/Chat/blob/master/screenshots/confirm_request.png?raw=true)  \r\n#### Online users\r\n![online users](https://github.com/sudheeshshetty/Chat/blob/master/screenshots/online_users.png?raw=true)  \r\n\r\n#### Chatting with Friend\r\n![Chatting](https://github.com/sudheeshshetty/Chat/blob/master/screenshots/chat.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n# Upcoming\r\nI have lot of things to do. \r\n* Bug fixes.\r\n* More feauters to come, like blocking a user from chatting etc.  \r\n* Option for saving chats in case you need it.
